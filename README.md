#Notes

This repo doesn't use github the way it was intended to be used, because it simply has a bunch of markdown files that I wrote while learning different languages. Anyone can use these files, but I don't know how much help they could be (except for the links to the tutorials I saw may be) because they are quite specific to the pace and order I learned things in. I am sure it could be good as a refresher or a quick (not detailed) reference in some cases.
I hope it serves you well.
