* To run a ruby script use 'ruby progname' and to access the shell 'irb'
* In order to comment something use #
* 'puts' is the main printing method in ruby
* 'puts' = 'print' + \n
* Arthmitics are similar to other programming languages
* In order to print a variable inside a string, one can use string interpolation by using #{variable} or one can use format sequences with [] on the outside instead of () in python
*  Using puts <<ANYCAPITALWORD before a string and ANYCAPITALWORD after is equivilant to printing a multiple line strings in python (""" """)
* In ruby 'gets' is for inputing data to the program. 'gets.chomp()' removes the \n at the end of the input
* 'require' acts as 'import' in python and 'input' in C. On the other hand, 'input' in ruby is somethign related to classes.
* To unpack arguments given  to the script, one sets the variables = ARGV, where variables could be 'first, second, third' or anything else.
* The Name of the script is saved in $0
* If you use ARGV in a file, one should use STDIN.gets instead of gets on it's own and I don't really understand the reason
* ri is a program that looks up ruby methods
* array.first returns 1st obj in array
* like in python obj, = array is acceptable. In the previous example obj takes the value of the first object in the array
* The syntax of a function is 'def funcName(args) \n\t #whatever you want to do \n end'
* *args is one of the ways to initiate arrays in Ruby, similar to C of course. (btw puts -put string- is also from C)
* In ruby, you can use 'return' in a function, or the result of the last statement is automatically returned in ruby, 'return' is optional (weired, but not bad)
* Functions here cout just be a set of commands that reutrn a value, therefore they can exchangable with variables anywhere. So one should use () after a functions only when args are passed or to avoid confusion, which is probably a huge drawback of this.
* Using 'module' allows you to make a lib of functions to use in your programs
